# Machine Learning Toolbox

The main program can apply several supervised classification methods on data:
  - Logistic regression (linear model)
  - SVM
  - Bagging
  - Random forest
  - Neural network
  
Some other tools are available like Boosting, K-mean, Linear-regression.

This program uses different external toolbox:
  - `Prtools` for Bagging and Random forest
  - `DeepLearnToolbox-master` for Neural network
  - `libsvm-3.20` for SVM
  
Moreover, some piece of code come from the Coursera MOOC by Andrew Ng: [Machine Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).
